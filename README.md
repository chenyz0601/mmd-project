#### Data
subset of [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/), 10000 songs (compressed 1.8G).<br>
#### Project 1: duplicate detection
using Locality Sensitive Hashing and cosin distance.<br>
#### Project 2: song recommendation （part 1）
using Latent Factor Models.<br>
using alternative optimization to find the latent factor of the user-song-count matrix.<br>
#### Project 3: song recommendation （part 2）
using Gradient Dencent, SGD and mini-batch SGD to solve the latent factor problem.<br>
#### Project 4: song ranking
compute the song similarity, and build a similarity network of songs.<br>
using Topic-Specific PageRank to rank songs.<br>
#### Project 5: song clustering
using network in project4 to construct a weighted adjacency matrix.<br>
performing spectral clustering on it, support normalized and un-normalized graph Laplacian.
