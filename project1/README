| THE FINAL PROJECT FILE IS dd_matrix.ipynb |
---------------------------------------------

Please create a file with the name 'config' in the same directory as mmds.ipynb with the following structure:

[MainSection]
dataset_location:/home/leboudy/mmds-project-dependencies/MillionSongSubset/
code_location:/home/leboudy/mmds-project-dependencies
number_of_songs_to_process: 100000
hashalgorithm=md5
features:duration,end_of_fade_in,key,loudness,mode,start_of_fade_out,tempo,time_signature
number_of_rows_each_band:63
number_of_bands:3
tolerance_diff:2



in the config file please insert:
dataset_location = the correct path to your local copy of the millionsongs dataset
code_location =  location where the pythonsrc folder lives
hashalgorithm = #hashing algorithm try print(hashlib.algorithms_available) print(hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed) to show all of the available ones
features =  the features desired for hashing as a comma separated string
number_of_rows_each_band: r
number_of_bands:b
tolerance_diff: epsilon
